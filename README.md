# Multiple Disease Prediction 

The project entails the development of a web application integrating machine learning algorithms to forecast a range of diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease.

## About:
This web application offers a user-friendly interface for predicting multiple diseases based on diverse input features. Utilizing machine learning models trained on pertinent datasets, the application ensures precise predictions.

The diseases covered by this web application encompass:

Diabetes

Parkinson's disease

Heart disease

## Models:
The machine learning models integrated into this web application are trained on publicly available datasets tailored to each specific disease. Here's a concise overview of each model:

Diabetes Model: This model assesses the probability of an individual having diabetes by analyzing input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

Parkinson's Disease Model: Utilizing features extracted from voice recordings, this model determines the likelihood of Parkinson's disease in an individual.

Heart Disease Model: By considering a range of clinical and demographic features, this model predicts the presence of heart disease in individuals.

These models collectively empower the web application to offer accurate disease predictions based on comprehensive data analysis.
